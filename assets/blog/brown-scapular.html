In a fit of pride i found myself disproving of the good father rick of giving
the scapular. It was the haughty tone echoed in the words of the most recent
catechsim. Heresies never know they are hereies, and I did not know just how

I know why I had a spiritual dry period. Bible quoate about first love,
something I had once known but long since forgotten. St. Augustine quotation
about perseverance being given only to those who pray and ask. Cardinal Collins,
gentle in ministry, effecient in action, and constant in prayer. In this I have
been given graces beyond compare: Mary's garment, the lovely habit. She has been
so good to me, I am compelled to trumpet both Mother and Son from this lonely
virtual pulprit given me.

<p>
distinction that had escaped me just earlier. Ordinary state of investiture, the
passive wearing of the Scapular, is a pious act in which perseverance will be
ultimately rewarded with victory. (priest baptism analogy). but not the state in
which Satan cannot frequently vanquish us. An active realization of the Scapular
is a state in which we are affiliated to Mary in moments of temptation and
instinctively fly to Her at the first sign of the enemy. 140, devotion of minds
(homage), our wills (confidence), and our hearts (love). A deeper more perfect
imitation requires a PERFECT devotion, adding to the previous three elements the
element of IMITATION.
</p>

<p>
Something I just realized, when reading the exorcist authors, I experience a
heightened realization and awareness, a slight sense of uneasiness, of being
watched. Similar to, but more vivid to a horror movie. Believe me, I prefer the
long and well trodden (but narrow) road to salvation over a more dangerous
cliffside path. But with the Scapular, I am quite my normal phlegmatic self.
