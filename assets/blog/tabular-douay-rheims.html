<span class="dropcap">H</span>aving recently undergone the
Rite of Initiation, I fear if I didn't make an effort to read the Bible now I
would only find more excuses in the future. I wanted a way to read sacred
scripture and commentaries without having multiple PDF's open side by side and
having to scroll back and forth between them<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> .query-syntax
</p>

<p>
Necessity being the mother of invention is a bit of a misnomer here. Indeed, I
want to clarify that nothing original has been added or subtracted. Whatever
techniques used to get the text into a table format is nothing compared to the
efforts of copyists and scribes beforehand<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> . I hope this formatting proves
to be of use to more than myself.

Michael H's work is based on previous work by an unknown transcriber, whose base
text was the 1859 edition of <i>Haydock's Catholic Family Bible and Commentary</i>
printed by Edward Dunigan and Brother, New York, New York. It is thanks to the
work of archivists that the 1852, 1855 and 1883 editions of Haydock's Bible have
been digitized and made publicly available. The links to the digitized originals
&#x2013; and other mediums &#x2013; can be found at <a href="https://catholicebooks.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/online-ebook-haydocks-catholic-bible-commentary-1859-edition/">the Catholic eBooks Project</a>.

<p>
More modest goal of archival purpose. What is missing is bernards introduction
to the bible. I also highly recommend kreefts you can understand the bible.
I'm not sure if imprimateurs need to be sought or if the current one carries
through. The substance of the work has not changed. This is a digitization of
Haydock's Bible into modern hypertext markup language (clickable links!).
All errors are mine, so I would appreciate any help.

<p>
My fellow converts (and reverts), admirers of C.S. Lewis and those curious about
Christianity hopefully can sympathize with me when I say that once we have
returned upon those familiar shores with fresh eyes a couple of pressing
questions avail themselves,
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>"Which denomination is the true one?" I believe you don't need schooling to
recognize &#x2013; on some intuitive level &#x2013; unity as one of the five
transcendentals.</li>

<li>"Which version of the Bible should I read?"</li>
</ol>

<p>
For the first, I can only rely on John Henry Newman's recommendation to steep
ourselves in history.
</p>

<p>
As for the second, an apologia for the Douay Rheims can be found from TAN
publishing [<a href="#nelsonWhichBibleShould2001">1</a>]. I feel the need to clear myself
of my imaginary accuser from being a 'KJV-onlyist' or 'Douay Rheims-onlyist'.
After all the very same council which sanctioned the Vulgate also ordered for
its revision,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It decides and declares that the old well known Latin Vulgate edition [ipsa
vetus et vulgata editio] which has been tested in the church by long use over so
many centuries should be kept as the authentic text in public readings, debates,
sermons and explanations; and no one is to dare or presume on any pretext to
reject it. […T]he council decrees and determines that hereafter the sacred
scriptures, particularly in this ancient Vulgate edition, shall be printed after
a thorough revision&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; from Trans. from Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils, 2:664. Accessed at
   <a href="https://www.calledtocommunion.com/2011/06/calvin-trent-and-the-vulgate-misinterpreting-the-fourth-session/#footnote_13_8243">Calvin, Trent, and the Vulgate: Misinterpreting the Fourth Session | Called
   t&#x2026;</a>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe for those seeking a literal translation that is close to the Vulgate
(i.e. those who lack the privilege of a classical education in greek and latin),
the closest that exists in english to the best of my knowledge is the Douay. I
find the commentary definitely helps.
</p>

<p>
<i>Divinio afflante Spiritu</i> authorizes translations based on textual sources
other than the Vulgate. The very same encyclical is very careful not to demote
the juridicial basis of the Vulgate. It is worthy to note that the Clementine
Vulgate / Nova Vulgata remains the official Bible of the church. 1943 was not
that long ago, in the whole scheme of things, and these things take time. It is
very much an ongoing work: Professor Robert Miller at the Catholic University of
America states "In a couple of years there will be another bible, so if somebody
buys a bible now, I'm going to tell him to go back to the store in a couple of
years and buy it again,".
</p>

<p>
Therefore to better understand the whole, it is necessary to look at the history
of English Bibles. For brevity's sake, we skip over the early Church and its use
of the Old Latin Bible (Vetus Itala). Even as I gloss over this period of
history, I want to give no quarter to the pernicious falsehoods of "the
anonymous Gospels" or Bart Ehrman's "time gap" between Jesus and the Gospels. As
with the rest of this essay, I will rely on the authority of others to address
this, namely Dr. Brant Pitre's exposition for us laymen in
[<a href="#thecaseforejesus">thecaseforejesus</a>].
</p>

<p>
Commissioned by Pope St. Damasus for a translation to replace to Vetus Itala,
St. Jerome completed the Latin Vulgate in A.D. 405. From there it remained in
use for roughly a millennium until the Council of Trent who, in fighting the
Protestant heresy, gave the solemn decree quoted above. Indeed it was in this
climate, in this baptism of fire, that the original Douay Rheims (A.D. NT 1582,
OT 1610) was born.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"diverse learned Catholics, for the more speedy abolishing of a number of false
and impious translations put forth by sundry sects, and for the better
preservation or <b>reclaim of many good souls endangered thereby,</b> have published
the Bible in the several languages of almost all the principal provinces of the
Latin Church, no other books in the world being so pernicious as heretical
translations {408} of the Scriptures, poisoning the people under colour of
divine authority, and <b>not many other remedies being more sovereign against the
same (if it be used in order, discretion, and humility) than the true, faithful,</b>
<b>and sincere interpretation opposed thereunto</b> &#x2026; We, therefore, having
compassion to see our beloved countrymen, with extreme danger of their souls, to
use only such profane translations and erroneous men's mere fantasies, for the
pure and blessed word of truth, much also moved thereunto by the desires of many
devout persons, have set forth for you, benign readers, the New Testament to
begin withal, trusting that it may give occasion to you, after diligent perusal
thereof, to lay away at least such their impure versions as hitherto you have
been forced to occupy."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whew. And I was told my run-on sentences were bad. Joking aside, we again turn
to <a href="https://www.newmanreader.org/works/tracts/douayrheims.html">Cardinal Newman for his analysis on the evolution of the Douay Rheims</a>.
Whereby one can conclude that the 1899 DRA commonly used in our time ought to be
called not the Douay Rheims; it is more aptly described as the Douay
Rheims-Challoner-Troy with annotations by Fr. George Leo Haydock. As an aside,
Newman had praise for the 1852 edition of Haydock's Bible, calling it
'splendid'. I just think it's cool that anybody with internet today can <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433017068051&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=25&amp;skin=2021">view the
original 1852 edition</a>. What was in the past the privilege of an educated select
few with access to Universities and Libraries is now public domain. But I
digress. We can look at the <a href="https://archive.org/details/1582DouaiRheimsDouayRheimsFirstEdition1Of31609OldTestament/page/n537/mode/2up">1582 Douay Rheims</a> and agree that while not complete
gibberish, it is in need of a revision; a horizontal analogy to the state of the
19th century Douay Rheims editions and our modern translations. N.B. It would
also be historically and intellectually dishonest to ignore looming example of
"impious translations put forth by sundry sects" in the form of the King James
Version (KJV) Bible commissioned by the Church of England. As noted by Cardinal
Newman, there was a fair amount of "cross-pollination" and borrowing between the
two.
</p>

<p>
And so the Douay Rheims takes us to 20th and 21st century. The New Testament of
the Confraternity Bible was in fact completed in 1941, right before Pope Pius
XII penned <i>Divinio afflante Spiritu</i> in 1943. It was destined to be replaced by
the New American Bible (NAB), itself replaced by the New American Bible Revised
Edition (NABRE). There is the Knox Bible, the New Jersualem, the modernizing of
the KJV in the form of the Revised Standard Version (RSV, RSV-CE, NRSV, NRSV-CE)
etc. It does seem to the English speaking Faithful that there is a veritable
Cambrian explosion of translations, change, generation and corruption.
</p>

<p>
Fr. Wilfred Harrignton notes with a hint of irony how "the disparate Protestant
groups unite around their one common touchstone, that is, unity against the
Catholic Church and so followed the Jewish tradition [in the canonicity of the
Old Testament]". But with that obvious example aside, more importantly he states
that like the Incarnation the Bible is exactly the same: fully the word of God,
and fully the work of human languages.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
But in order to achieve this desired result it is necessary that the <b>scholar
should be guided not only by his scholarship,</b> not only by his faith in the
divine origin of Scripture, but <b>also by the teaching office of the Church.</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And with such a supernatural end necessitates supernatural help; the revelation
of the Most Holy Trinity as Father, Son and Spirit. The corruption is that of
"inclusive language"; to corrupt Sons of God and yet (rightfully) retain
Daughters of Jerusalem; to fight the patriarchy through removal of photos,
soviet style. Male and female He made them, and I hope those who treat this not
as a reality carved in stone but as a line drawn &#x2013; and to be redrawn &#x2013; in sand
will agree me with me when I say the end goal of such forward thinkers is to
erase any distinctions, to tear down the Chestertonian fence and remake
themselves in their own image.
</p>

<p>
My background is technical, and not in the liberal arts. So for those who also
have been trained to recoil at words like mystical, supernatural,
supra-rational, and revelation, let us remind ourselves that our minds are
finte, that madmen are mad precisely because they have lost everything but their
reason LINK CHESTERTON. That there is no contradiction between faith and reason.
LINK AQUINAS 101. And that we humble ourselves in gratitude for the grace of
conversion being continuously given to those who petition and pray, top down.
</p>

<p>
But have prophetesses not preached? So says the Bible itself.
</p>

<p>
Is it not the case that God is not a biological being, but Being itself,
possessing no gender? I AM WHO AM?
</p>

<p>
Why don't we pray "Our Mother who art in Heaven?" Why then do Catholics accord
Mary the honor of being the greatest human being who had ever lived, above the
angels and saints?
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The innovators are really implying that <b>sex is something superficial, irrelevant
to the spiritual life.</b> To say that men and women are equally eligible for a
certain profession is to say that for the purposes of that profession their sex
is irrelevant. We are, within that context, treating both as neuters.
</p>

<p>
As the State grows more like a hive or an ant-hill it needs an increasing number
of workers who can be treated as neuters. This may be inevitable for our secular
life. But in our Christian life we must return to reality. There we are not
homogeneous units, but different and complementary organs of a mystical body.
Lady Nunburnholme has claimed that the equality of men and women is a Christian
principle. I do not remember the text in scripture nor the Fathers, nor Hooker,
nor the Prayer Book which asserts it; but that is not here my point. <b>The point
is that unless "equal" means "interchangeable"</b>, equality makes nothing for the
priesthood of women. And <b>the kind of equality which implies that the equals are
interchangeable</b> (like counters or identical machines) <b>is, among humans, a legal
fiction.</b> It may be a useful legal fiction. But in church we turn our back on
fictions. One of the ends for which sex was created was to symbolize to us the
hidden things of God. One of the functions of human marriage is to express the
nature of the union between Christ and the Church. <b>We have no authority</b> to take
the living and semitive figures which God has painted on the canvas of our
nature and shift them about as if they were mere geometrical figures.
</p>

<p>
This is what common sense will call "mystical". Exactly. The Church claims to be
the bearer of a revelation. <b>If that claim is false then we want not to make
priestesses but to abolish priests.</b> If it is true, then we should expect to find
in the Church an element which unbelievers will call irrational and which
believers will call supra-rational. There ought to be something in it opaque to
our reason though not contrary to it - as the facts of sex and sense on the
natural level are opaque. And that is the real issue. The Church of England can
remain a church only if she retains this opaque element. If we abandon that, if
we retain only what can be justified by standards of prudence and convenience at
the bar of enlightened common sense, then we exchange revelation for that old
wraith Natural Religion.

<p>
The whole essay is well worth your time. I lack the training to clearly name
such an error in thinking, but I hope I am not alone when I say this line of
thought shares much alike with no heaven no hell no judgement no evil. peter

Taking after a modern st damian liber gomorrah, Leon padello in his book
sacriledge, names a phenonenom of laypople leaving holiness to the priests and
nuns. Tempting and a familiar temptation to myself. We promise a christian, not
military obedience. And even military obedience is not absolute, one of the
first things the army teaches you is that while they have every right to order
you into imminent danger (and have your will on file), you have the
responsibility, the duty, to refuse an unlawful order. St. Thomas More
proclaims: you are the Kings' good servant, but God's first. Nor is The Angelic
doctor silent on limits of obedience. But with all that said, obedience is a
wonderful virtue rooted in humility. Worry not about things too high for you, we
will be given milk to drink. The curation of souls is left to the presbyters,
the princes, and the prelates of the Church. Much more will be expected from
those who have been given much, and the The Good Shepherd will ask them if they
love Him, and have they fed His sheep. The Sucessors of the Apostles have every
preogative to set the edition of the English Bible to use in liturgy. I believe
the Douay Rheims is primarily fruitful for private study; the Douay Rheims does
need modern English and I repeat as above, that a realistic assessment of our
place in time matter space. In the year of our lord 2022, this is an ongoing
work.
</p>

<p>
If I haven't convinced you to take a look at the Douay Rheims, that's no
problemo at all. I hope you'll agree with me that it is worth transcribing to an
online format, even if only for historical and academic interest. Ending rosary
prayer. May Mother Mary keep us always in her protection and free from error.
Pie in the sky academic discussion aside, as my old man says: the best tool is
the one you have on ya.
