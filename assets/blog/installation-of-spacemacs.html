<span class="dropcap">I</span>s it possible to judge whether
or not a piece of music is objectively good, perfect and beautiful? The word
"objectively" must sound a bit old fashioned, after all, every man is doing what
is right in his own eyes in these times<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>. But we can be reasonably certain
that a song which has been well loved generation after generation has a quality
absent from a yet untested, recently released album. Yes, I'm talking about
Emacs here. 40 odd years is a terribly long time in the world of software. We
have reason to be grateful as Spacemacs has done its part in flattening the
notorious Emacs learning curve. But enough evangelizing. This comprehensive
tutorial can be said to be directed towards non-programmers who are comfortable
with computing (as this write-up originally existed as personal notes of mine).
I hope you take away something useful!
</p>

<p>
I feel obliged to point out that there exist multiple popular ways of installing
Emacs on a Windows machine. You may compile Emacs source code and run it
"natively" through <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>. Another option is to run a virtual linux machine and
install Emacs from there. Because installing natively would mean more
workarounds in the future when dealing with external software and also because
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) offers better system call compatibility, I
elected to go down the more well trodden path of running Emacs on Ubuntu through
WSL. In the simplest terms, WSL is a very lightweight virtual machine that
allows you to use linux kernels to run linux applications in Windows <i>without</i>
dual booting.
</p>

<p>
Originally there existed limitations around graphical linux applications. <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/whats-new-in-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-september-2020/#gui-apps">One of
my first updates to this article was to note the coming of built-in graphical
support without the need for an external X server.</a> The future has come to pass,
and the changes (in the form of WSLg) have landed in Windows 11. Those hoping
for a backporting of WSLg to Windows 10 are being told to <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/347#issuecomment-971126353%20">"wait one"</a>. A <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/a-preview-of-wsl-in-the-microsoft-store-is-now-available/">preview
of WSL in the Microsoft store</a> also states a Windows 11 requirement. Not feeling
very optimistic about the time-frame for Windows 10 WSLg, I decided to go ahead
and upgrade to Windows 11.
</p>

<p>
I have kept the old Windows 10 WSL installation walk through and have added my
experience on setting up WSL on Windows 11.

Prerequisites
</p>

<p>
Check that you meet the requirements for running WSL2. "Win + r", type in
"winver" and hit enter. Open command prompt or powerhsell and enter:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">systeminfo | find <span class="org-string">"System Type"</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Compare your Windows version with the below
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For x64 systems: Version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or higher.</li>
<li>For ARM64 systems: Version 2004 or higher, with Build 19041 or higher.</li>

<h3 id="Install-Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux-WSL-Your-Linux-Distribution"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Install Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) &amp; Your Linux Distribution</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Install-Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux-WSL-Your-Linux-Distribution">
<p>
First, install the Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2. Unless
explicitly mentioned as WSL1, WSL refers to WSL version 2. WSL2 is recommended
over WSL1 Unless you plan on using Linux commandline on files stored in the
Native Windows file system instead of the WSL filesystem. I will go into more
detail later, but the WSL filesystem is accessible in Windows Explorer and shows
up as a network drive. If you are unsure, go with WSL2. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-1---enable-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux">This process is already
documented by Microsoft (includes troubleshooting guidelines).</a> Repeated here for
completion's sake:
</p>

<p>
Enable the windows feature called "Windows subsystem for Linux" by either
checking the box in the GUI screen. You can get there by searching "Turn
Windows features on or off" in the control panel search box. Do the same for
the check box titled "virtual machine platform". you can enable these 2
features via the shell as well.
</p>

<p>
OR open the power shell as administrator and run:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
</pre>
</div>

<p>
now you have to download and run the Linux kernel update package from Microsoft. Again make sure you download the right one for your CPU architecture.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi">https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi</a></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_arm64.msi">https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_arm64.msi</a>
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, set WSL 2 as the default version when you install a new
Linux distribution.
</p>

<p>
Open the powershell and run:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">wsl --set-default-version 2
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now you can go to the window store and download your preferred Linux distribution. I went with Ubuntu. One thing to note is that you may find three results when you search Ubuntu in the Windows store.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ubuntu (This one updates to the latest long term support version)</li>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04 (Stays on 20.04 LTS)</li>
<li><p>
Ubuntu 18.04 (Stays on 18.04 LTS)
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual">If for some reason you are unable to download applications from the Windows
store, you can install the distribution through manual methods.</a> After
installing through the window store, launching the Ubuntu will ask you for a
username and password for your superuser account.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Install-X-Server" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="Install-X-Server"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Install X Server</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Install-X-Server">
<p>
This is the software that allows Linux to display GUI elements. You have
many options here:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Xming</li>
<li>Mobaxterm</li>
<li>Vcxsrv</li>
</ol>

<p>
I have chosen Vcxsrv. Simple installation and configuration.
Download and run the sourceforge
installer and you can launch the program by the "Xlaunch" shortcut. No
need to change any of the settings. Click next until the end and you should
see a system tray icon. Feel free to add the "X Launch" shortcut to your
Windows (Win + R) folder.
</p>

<p>
After installation, create a new desktop shortcut and use the following
command. Add the following command in the properties → shortcut →target
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh"><span class="org-string">"C:\Program Files\VcXsrv\vcxsrv.exe"</span> :0 -ac -terminate -lesspointer -multiwindow -clipboard -wgl -dpi auto
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The last step before launching is to configure your X Server correctly. In
the WSL terminal, export the DISPLAY variable.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">$ export <span class="org-variable-name">DISPLAY</span>=$<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span><span class="org-sh-quoted-exec">awk '/nameserver / {print $2; exit}' /etc/resolv.conf 2&gt;/dev/null</span><span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span>:0
$ export <span class="org-variable-name">LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT</span>=1
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The reason for the above is because the internal IP address of the WSL (2)
server changes on reboot. Don't worry, the team at WSL has ensured that
connections to WSL from Windows (Ex. localhost:8000) require no extra
configuration. The snippet above for is for WSL to Windows 10 GUI applications.
You will probably want to put the two export commands into your .bashrc file,
located in '~/home/$USER$/' folder. We can do this after completing the steps
below.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0aeae80" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0aeae80"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Install Emacs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Spacemacs is a preset configuration of Emacs, so we must first make sure Emacs
is installed properly. The default Emacs build that comes with Ubuntu 20.04 on
WSL doesn't support XWindows (the X Server we just installed). To fix this we
are going to add Kevin Kelley's builds of Emacs with XWindows supports, simply
by adding Kevin's PPA to WSL. Enter the following in the WSL Terminal.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kelleyk/emacs
sudo apt update
sudo apt install emacs27

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
If the Windows 10 installation process seems replete with hacks and workarounds,
then let us rejoice at the new features added to WSL in the form of WSLg. WSLg
has built-in support for graphical applications &#x2013; both the Wayland protocol and
the X window system &#x2013; and pulseaudio. This simplifies the process considerably.
</p>

<p>
I am currently using a Thinkpad T470s that met all the Windows 11 requirements
with the exception of a greater than 8th generation Intel CPU. Despite the
official Windows 11 upgrade assistant refusing to allow an upgrade, using <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/">Rufus</a>
to create a Windows 11 installation media worked flawlessly. The usual caveats
apply. Backup any personal data, backup your Windows 10 product key, and check
that the OEM has Windows 11 drivers for your model etc. Here I'd like to take a
moment to thank Intel and Lenovo's Thinkpad group for providing Windows 11
drivers for the 5 year old T470s with the Intel i5 6300-U. Support for your
machine may vary. Please be careful.

Ubuntu 22.04 and above should work with WSLg out of the box. The beginner

<p>
I wrote the initial tutorial for Windows 10, for Emacs was also my introduction
into the world of UNIX and Lisp. That, combined with the desire to remind my
future forgetful self was the reason for the surface-level depth and hand
holding steps. Now if you count yourself comfortable in such an environment, I
can think of a few good reasons to install Emacs from source at this point in
time.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>When Emacs 28+ is configured with the flag <code>--with-native-compilation</code> Emacs
Lisp bytecode is translated to C and then machine code, yielding performance
benefits.</li>

<li>WSLg uses Wayland and Emacs 29.0.50 master has the pure GTK feature instead
of relying on the older X window system.</li>

<li>Debian does not build emacs with the flag <code>--with-xwidgets</code> for security
reasons. With this feature enabled, Emacs is able to embed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webkit">Webkit</a> browser
widget inside a buffer. Compared to Emacs EWW which has HTML and limited CSS
support, xwidget-webkit renders HTML, CSS and Javascript. Currently the
xwidgets-webkit browser crashes to desktop on websites like Reddit or
Youtube.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Currently Debian bullseye packages Emacs 27.1. And for the record, I find such
attention to stability perfectly reasonable. I am not familiar at all with the
typical C build process, so <a href="https://batsov.com/articles/2021/12/19/building-emacs-from-source-with-pgtk/%20">Mr. Batsov's advice helped.</a> Onto the build process,

Installing with a utility like <code>checkinstall</code> does package a <code>.deb</code>, allowing
you to remove the Emacs source folder and then at a later point in time call
<code>sudo apt purge emacs</code>. However running <code>sudo checkinstall</code> inside <code>M-x shell</code>
while compiling <a href="https://github.com/djcb/mu">mu</a> (while it worked fine for Emacs?) broke my old Windows
10/WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04 system badly. I did not press Ctrl-C or interrupt the
install in any way, but the outcome was the same. I regret not being able to
give a more detailed bug report, for it screwed my system good and proper. See
</p>

Enter the following in your WSL terminal to install Spacemacs from the develop

more quickly on develop. You have the option to change later on. Make sure git
is installed on Ubuntu and clone the Spacemacs repo.

<p>
On the initial startup, you will be presented with a few choices. Pick "All

Rest assured, you will be able to change the first option later on in your
dotspacemacs (~/.spacemacs) file and if you are a beginner, the full
installation is preferred over the base installation. In the first initial
startup, you will have to wait for all the MELPA packages to download and
install. MELPA is the package manager for all Emacs packages. After the
download is completed, you will have successfully installed Spacemacs.

A couple of first steps to get yourself grounded. Makre sure you take
caution to avoid the dreaded Emacs pinkie. Repetitive strain injury and
carpal tunnel are painful and debilitating. Personally, I have made the
following changes to my keyboard layout to make it more ergonomic. The
benefits spill over to applications outside of Emacs as well. To do so:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys">Install Microsoft PowerToys</a></li>
<li>Under the Keyboard Remapper, swap right ctrl and right alt.</li>
<li>swap left ctrl and left alt.</li>
<li>swap left alt (physically the left ctrl key) with the Windows key. This
will retain comfortable alt-tabbing.</li>
<li><p>
swap esc with caps lock.
</p>

<p>
Emacs is designed to be keyboard driven, although scrolling and mouse
support works out of the box. Now let's get started.

If are new or want a brushup, access the built in tutorial via "SPC h T v"
in Spacemacs ("SPC h T e" for the emacs version). If you pause after
hitting "SPC", you will see a popup. This package is called
<a href="https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key">"emacs-which-key"</a> and it
frees you for remembering 1001 commands. Like memorizing a piano piece, you
will pick up your most commonly used bindings soon enough. To extend this
analogy further, Spacemacs bindings are not without reason, but are
designed to be mnemonic. If you are new to vim's way of modal editing, here
is some helpful reading:

Almost all configuration will be done in your ~/.spacemacs file. For a

Spacemacs places it's help commands under "SPC h", so give those a try. A
hint for new users, "SPC h d", opens up a plethora of information. I'm am
proceeding under the assumption you have watched the video in 1) and so one
of the topics only lightly discussed was the concept of major and minor
modes. A buffer can have one major mode, and multiple minor modes. Of
course, Emacs being Emacs, it's possible to have two major modes
<a href="https://github.com/polymode/polymode">with the package Polymode.</a> "SPC h
d b" will pull up a buffer describing the currently active modes. You can
access the Spacemacs beginner tutorial with "SPC h SPC", and then typing in
"Beginner's Tutorial". Now you can navigate the tutorial with the movement
keys you have just learned.
<a href="https://develop.spacemacs.org/doc/BEGINNERS_TUTORIAL.html">The tutorial
is also accessible here (or in Emacs, "SPC h r").</a>

<p>
Lastly here is a step by step example to install
<a href="https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful">the "helpful" package.</a> This is just
a concrete example of package installation &amp; configuration process. This
particular package was chosen simply because it extends the
"self-documenting" aspect of Emacs.
</p>

<p>
If you have found a useful Emacs package, the installation differs slightly
than vanilla Emacs. The first thing to do is check the
<a href="https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/LAYERS.html">spacemacs develop
layers list</a> to see if a layer has included your desired package. Lets do
that with the "helpful" package. Huh.
<a href="https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+emacs/helpful/README.html">So it is
already included in a layer!</a> That makes life easier for us, we can follow
the README installation instructions. Remember you can access your
dotspacemacs configuration file with "SPC f e d". Don't forget to hit "SPC
f e R" to reload your configuration after adding the layer to your
~/.spacemacs file.
</p>

<p>
Now if your package is not already pre-configured in a layer, it is most
likely either on MELPA or Github. If it is a local package, I'm afraid
you'll have to consult the README.md found in ~/.emacs.d/private/local . In
fact, that README contains all the information we need for all three use
cases above. Quoted below:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>For a local package:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Load the file explicitly, using the full path to the file, by placing a
</p>

<p>
\`(load "~/.emacs.d/private/local/package-name")\` within the body of
the \`dotspacemacs/user-config\` function of your dotspacemacs file.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Alternatively create a directory with the name of the package in the</li>
</ul>

<p>
\`.emacs.d/private/local\` directory, and add that directory to the
load-path variable by adding \`(some-package :location local)\` to the
list \`dotspacemacs-additional-packages\` within the
\`dotspacemacs/layers\` function of your dotspacemacs file. After
placing your package file into this package-directory the file can be
loaded, without requiring the full path, by placing a \`(require
'package-name)\` within the body of the \`dotspacemacs/user-config\`
function of your dotspacemacs file.
</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li>If the package is on (M)ELPA simply add the package name to the list
\`dotspacemacs-additional-packages\` in your dotspacemacs file</li>

<li><p>
For a package hosted on github the recipe for github packages can be used i.e. add
</p>

<p>
\`\`\` (some-package :location (recipe :fetcher github :repo
"some/repo")) \`\`\`
</p>

<p>
to the list \`dotspacemacs-additional-packages\` in your dotspacemacs
file.
</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is no substitute for reading the documentation of the package. Or the
source code itself. Luckily, the package we are about to customize makes
the latter task slightly easier. Let us pretend we want to customize a
variable in our dotspacemacs file. Before we do that, let's switch to the
previously opened ~/.spacemacs (dotspacemacs) file buffer with "SPC b b".
</p>

<p>
One important point to keep in mind is that all key bindings are simply
calling a command. From the code and package docs we can see that
"helpful-variable" is a command. To run any interactive function in Emacs,
we will use M-x ("alt-x" or the Spacemacs way: "SPC SPC") and type in
"helpful-variable". Before we run it by hitting RET (enter), we notice &#x2013;
thanks to helm, an emacs completion package &#x2013; that the keybinding already
set for that command is "C-h v". Good to know. Press ESC to exit.
</p>

<p>
"SPC b d", ESC, q and C-g are the common default bindings to close a buffer
or window.
</p>

<p>
In our dotspacemacs file let's press "SPC s s" and type in
"dotspacemacs-themes". Make sure our cursor is placed on the variable
"dotspacemacs-themes" and use the keybind we learned earlier: "C-h v". The
variable at our cursor is filled in and a helpful buffer is drawn up. Give
it a quick read. If you are curious you can compare it to "SPC h d v" with
the cursor on the same point. Try swapping the "dotspacemacs-themes"
variable. Save, "SPC f s" and reload "SPC f e R".

I have kept this for last because this adds quite a bit of complexity to the
installation process. It's best to make sure the above is familiar before
marching on. WSL2 networking is still very much a work in progress, and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/wslg">WSLg</a>
will be restricted to Windows 11 only. <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1474559/wsl2-x11-programs-disappear%20">Therefore X server sessions are not kept
alive</a> after the computer goes to sleep. This can be a deal breaker for some. If
that is the case, then here is the workaround I use: <a href="https://derkoe.dev/blog/development-environment-in-wsl2/%20">courtesy of Mr. Christian Koberl.</a>
</p>

<p>
DO NOT uninstall or change your previous VCXSRV setup. I keep both X2Go and
VCXSRV open as otherwise my clipboard will stop working. Hard to debug.
</p>

<p>
After each WSL/Windows restart
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Launch ssh in Linux (if not started yet): sudo service ssh start</li>
<li>Launch “X2Go Client” on Windows ad connect to the server with WSL user/password</li>
<li>Now you can launch X11 apps via the tray icon (see X2Go Published Applications)</li>
</ul>

<p>
To get sound you can use this link, <a href="https://www.linuxuprising.com/2021/03/how-to-get-sound-pulseaudio-to-work-on.html">How To Get Sound (PulseAudio) To Work On
WSL2 - Linux Uprising Blog</a>
</p>

<p>
The reason I do not use this option is due to battery usage as indicated by the
Windows task manager. X2go client uses pulseaudio server and the cpu usage for
<code>windows audio process</code> will be stuck around 8-10% CPU. My elfeed-mpv function
is also very slow. I will have to wait until Windows 11 with WSLg before
managing my music with Emacs.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Under Options → Settings → Pulseaudio settings, you can now disable audio input
(microphone support.) This itself is desirable for many users, but it also
serves as a workaround for the issue of PulseAudio failing to do output simply
because input is unavailable. &#x2013; <a href="https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:release-notes-mswin:x2goclient-4.0.5.1">doc:release-notes-mswin:x2goclient-4.0.5.1 {X2Go - everywhere@home}</a>

In the Lisp programming language family, Emacs Lisp is a derivative of the
Maclisp of the 1980's. For a general purpose programming language other lisp
dialects are better suited, such as ANSI Common Lisp. Emacs Lisp however remains
perfectly adequate as a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for editing text. As
recently as 2020 has the Emacs Lisp implementation gained the ability to compile
to native machine code with libgccgit.
</p>

That does not mean performance becomes less of a concern, as many Emacs configs
are treated less like a software program (for which typical best practices
apply) and more like a throwaway script hacked together by the worst of
copy-paste programming. I have learned the hard way that when it comes to subpar
Emacs performance, the culprit and resolution is not so different from
performance problems in other languages: check for errors in your own code or
the libraries you use. Performance comes from data structures, and efficiency
from algorithms. Even (premature) optimization out the wazoo will not save you
if those principles are ignored. However if we must optimize, then it would be
wise to profile first.

I have it on the authority of common sense and the Emacs maintainer that messing
with Emacs garbage collector is not a good idea. But if you must, check out the

To see what functions are running at set times, see the variables <code>timer-list</code>
and <code>timer-idle-list</code>.
