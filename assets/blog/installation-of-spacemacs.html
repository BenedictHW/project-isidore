Is it possible to judge whether or not a piece of music is objectively good,
perfect and beautiful? The word "objectively" must sound a bit old fashioned,
after all, every man is doing what is right in his own eyes in these times<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>.
But we can be reasonably certain that a song which has been well loved
generation after generation has a quality absent from a yet untested,
recently released album. Yes, I'm talking about Emacs here. 40 odd years is a
terribly long time in the world of software. We have reason to be grateful as
Spacemacs has done its part in flattening the notorious Emacs learning curve.
But enough evangelizing. This comprehensive tutorial can be said to be
directed towards non-programmers who are comfortable with computing (as this
write-up originally existed as personal notes of mine). I hope you take away
something useful!

Prerequisites
</p>

<p>
Check that you meet the requirements for running WSL2. "Win + r", type in
"winver" and hit enter. Open command prompt or powerhsell and enter:

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Install-Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux-WSL-Your-Linux-Distribution">
<p>
I feel obliged to point out that there exist multiple popular ways of
installing Emacs on a Windows machine. You may compile Emacs source code and
run it "natively" through <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>. Another option is to run a virtual linux
machine and install Emacs from there. Because installing natively would mean
more workarounds in the future when dealing with external software and also
because WSL offers better system call compatibility, I elected to go down
the more well trodden path of running Emacs on Ubuntu through WSL. In the
simplest terms, WSL is a very lightweight virtual machine that allows you to
use linux kernels to run linux apps in Windows <i>without</i> dual booting.
</p>

<p>
First, install the Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2. WSL 2 is
recommended over WSL 1 Unless you plan on using Linux commandline on files
stored in the Native Windows file system instead of the WSL filesystem. I
will go into more detail later, but the WSL filesystem is accessible in
Windows Explorer and shows up as a network drive. If you are unsure, go with
WSL2. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-1---enable-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux">This process is already documented by Microsoft (includes
troubleshooting guidelines).</a> Repeated here for completion's sake:
</p>

<p>
Enable the windows feature called "Windows subsystem for Linux" by either
checking the box in the GUI screen. You can get there by searching "Turn
Windows features on or off" in the control panel search box. Do the same for
the check box titled "virtual machine platform". you can enable these 2
features via the shell as well.
</p>

<p>
OR open the power shell as administrator and run:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
</pre>
</div>

<p>
now you have to download and run the Linux kernel update package from Microsoft. Again make sure you download the right one for your CPU architecture.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi">https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi</a></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_arm64.msi">https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_arm64.msi</a>
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, set WSL 2 as the default version when you install a new
Linux distribution.
</p>

<p>
Open the powershell and run:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">wsl --set-default-version <span class="org-highlight-numbers-number">2</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now you can go to the window store and download your preferred Linux distribution. I went with Ubuntu. One thing to note is that you may find three results when you search Ubuntu in the Windows store.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ubuntu (This one updates to the latest long term support version)</li>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04 (Stays on 20.04 LTS)</li>
<li><p>
Ubuntu 18.04 (Stays on 18.04 LTS)
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual">If for some reason you are unable to download applications from the Windows
store, you can install the distribution through manual methods.</a> After
installing through the window store, launching the Ubuntu will ask you for a
username and password for your superuser account.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Install-X-Server" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="Install-X-Server"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Install X Server</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Install-X-Server">
<p>
This is the software that allows Linux to display GUI elements. You have
many options here:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Xming</li>
<li>Mobaxterm</li>
<li>Vcxsrv</li>
</ol>

<p>
I have chosen Vcxsrv. Simple installation and configuration.
Download and run the sourceforge
installer and you can launch the program by the "Xlaunch" shortcut. No
need to change any of the settings. Click next until the end and you should
see a system tray icon. Feel free to add the "X Launch" shortcut to your
Windows (Win + R) folder.
</p>

<p>
After installation, create a new desktop shortcut and use the following
command. Add the following command in the properties → shortcut →target
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh"><span class="org-string">"C:\Program Files\VcXsrv\vcxsrv.exe"</span> :0 -ac -terminate -lesspointer -multiwindow -clipboard -wgl -dpi auto
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The last step before launching is to configure your X Server correctly. In
the WSL terminal, export the DISPLAY variable.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">$ export <span class="org-variable-name">DISPLAY</span>=$<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span><span class="org-sh-quoted-exec">awk</span> <span class="org-string">'/nameserver / {print $2; exit}'</span> /etc/resolv.conf <span class="org-highlight-numbers-number">2</span>&gt;/dev/null<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span>:0
$ export <span class="org-variable-name">LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT</span>=<span class="org-highlight-numbers-number">1</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The reason for the above is because the internal IP address of the WSL (2) server changes on reboot. Don't worry, the team at WSL has ensured that connections to WSL from Windows (Ex. localhost:8000) require no extra configuration. The snippet above for is for WSL to Windows 10 GUI applications. <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/whats-new-in-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-september-2020/#gui-apps">And WSL may be supporting GUI apps in the near future, so no X server would be needed.</a> You will probably want to put the two export commands into your .bashrc file, located in ~/home/$USER$/ folder. We can do this after completing the steps below.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Install-Spacemacs" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="Install-Spacemacs"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Install Spacemacs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Install-Spacemacs">
<p>
Spacemacs is a preset configuration of Emacs, so we must first make sure
Emacs is installed properly. The default Emacs build that comes with Ubuntu
on WSL doesn't support XWindows (the X Server we just installed). To fix
this we are going to add Kevin Kelley's builds of Emacs with XWindows
supports, simply by adding Kevin's PPA to WSL. Enter the following in the
WSL Terminal.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kelleyk/emacs
sudo apt update
sudo apt install emacs27
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Enter the following in your WSL terminal to install Spacemacs from the develop
branch. It is strongly recommended to use develop over master as bugs get fixed
more quickly on develop. You have the option to change later on. Make sure git
is installed on Ubuntu and clone the Spacemacs repo.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">git clone -b develop https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now for the moment of truth. Launch Spacemacs by the following command in the WSL terminal.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">$ emacs27 &amp;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
On the initial startup, you will be presented with a few choices. Pick "All
aboard the evil&#x2026;..Vim" and then "Full Installation" for the second choice.
Rest assured, you will be able to change the first option later on in your
dotspacemacs (~/.spacemacs) file and if you are a beginner, the full
installation is preferred over the base installation. In the first initial
startup, you will have to wait for all the MELPA packages to download and
install. MELPA is the package manager for all Emacs packages. After the
download is completed, you will have successfully installed Spacemacs.

A couple of first steps to get yourself grounded. Makre sure you take
caution to avoid the dreaded Emacs pinkie. Repetitive strain injury and
carpal tunnel are painful and debilitating. Personally, I have made the
following changes to my keyboard layout to make it more ergonomic. The
benefits spill over to applications outside of Emacs as well. To do so:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys">Install Microsoft PowerToys</a></li>
<li>Under the Keyboard Remapper, swap right ctrl and right alt.</li>
<li>swap left ctrl and left alt.</li>
<li>swap left alt (physically the left ctrl key) with the Windows key. This
will retain comfortable alt-tabbing.</li>
<li><p>
swap esc with caps lock.
</p>

<p>
Emacs is designed to be keyboard driven, although scrolling and mouse
support works out of the box. Now let's get started.

If are new or want a brushup, access the built in tutorial via "SPC h T v"
in Spacemacs ("SPC h T e" for the emacs version). If you pause after
hitting "SPC", you will see a popup. This package is called
<a href="https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key">"emacs-which-key"</a> and it
frees you for remembering 1001 commands. Like memorizing a piano piece, you
will pick up your most commonly used bindings soon enough. To extend this
analogy further, Spacemacs bindings are not without reason, but are
designed to be mnemonic. If you are new to vim's way of modal editing, here
is some helpful reading:

In terms of time efficiency, depth of content covered, and ease of
understanding, nothing
surpasses:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdLCuJcS2Aw">Spacemacs:
Installation, Configuration, and Navigation Tutorial - YouTube (20 min).</a>
I seriously and whole-heartedly recommend the rest of his videos.
Definitely try following along.
</p>

<p>
Almost all configuration will be done in your ~/.spacemacs file. For a
proper understanding of the ~/.spacemacs file,
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37076998/how-to-configure-spacemacs-so-that-it-executes-code-when-you-start-it">see
Streaky Cobra's breakdown of the file.</a> The only update to this
information is the placement of custom user layers and snippets in the
"private" directory of the ~/.emacs.d . But that is a worry for later.

Spacemacs places it's help commands under "SPC h", so give those a try. A
hint for new users, "SPC h d", opens up a plethora of information. I'm am
proceeding under the assumption you have watched the video in 1) and so one
of the topics only lightly discussed was the concept of major and minor
modes. A buffer can have one major mode, and multiple minor modes. Of
course, Emacs being Emacs, it's possible to have two major modes
<a href="https://github.com/polymode/polymode">with the package Polymode.</a> "SPC h
d b" will pull up a buffer describing the currently active modes. You can
access the Spacemacs beginner tutorial with "SPC h SPC", and then typing in
"Beginner's Tutorial". Now you can navigate the tutorial with the movement
keys you have just learned.
<a href="https://develop.spacemacs.org/doc/BEGINNERS_TUTORIAL.html">The tutorial
is also accessible here (or in Emacs, "SPC h r").</a>

<p>
Lastly here is a step by step example to install
<a href="https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful">the "helpful" package.</a> This is just
a concrete example of package installation &amp; configuration process. This
particular package was chosen simply because it extends the
"self-documenting" aspect of Emacs.
</p>

<p>
If you have found a useful Emacs package, the installation differs slightly
than vanilla Emacs. The first thing to do is check the
<a href="https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/LAYERS.html">spacemacs develop
layers list</a> to see if a layer has included your desired package. Lets do
that with the "helpful" package. Huh.
<a href="https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+emacs/helpful/README.html">So it is
already included in a layer!</a> That makes life easier for us, we can follow
the README installation instructions. Remember you can access your
dotspacemacs configuration file with "SPC f e d". Don't forget to hit "SPC
f e R" to reload your configuration after adding the layer to your
~/.spacemacs file.
</p>

<p>
Now if your package is not already pre-configured in a layer, it is most
likely either on MELPA or Github. If it is a local package, I'm afraid
you'll have to consult the README.md found in ~/.emacs.d/private/local . In
fact, that README contains all the information we need for all three use
cases above. Quoted below:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>For a local package:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Load the file explicitly, using the full path to the file, by placing a
</p>

<p>
\`(load "~/.emacs.d/private/local/package-name")\` within the body of
the \`dotspacemacs/user-config\` function of your dotspacemacs file.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Alternatively create a directory with the name of the package in the</li>
</ul>

<p>
\`.emacs.d/private/local\` directory, and add that directory to the
load-path variable by adding \`(some-package :location local)\` to the
list \`dotspacemacs-additional-packages\` within the
\`dotspacemacs/layers\` function of your dotspacemacs file. After
placing your package file into this package-directory the file can be
loaded, without requiring the full path, by placing a \`(require
'package-name)\` within the body of the \`dotspacemacs/user-config\`
function of your dotspacemacs file.
</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li>If the package is on (M)ELPA simply add the package name to the list
\`dotspacemacs-additional-packages\` in your dotspacemacs file</li>

<li><p>
For a package hosted on github the recipe for github packages can be used i.e. add
</p>

<p>
\`\`\` (some-package :location (recipe :fetcher github :repo
"some/repo")) \`\`\`
</p>

<p>
to the list \`dotspacemacs-additional-packages\` in your dotspacemacs
file.
</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is no substitute for reading the documentation of the package. Or the
source code itself. Luckily, the package we are about to customize makes
the latter task slightly easier. Let us pretend we want to customize a
variable in our dotspacemacs file. Before we do that, let's switch to the
previously opened ~/.spacemacs (dotspacemacs) file buffer with "SPC b b".
</p>

<p>
One important point to keep in mind is that all key bindings are simply
calling a command. From the code and package docs we can see that
"helpful-variable" is a command. To run any interactive function in Emacs,
we will use M-x ("alt-x" or the Spacemacs way: "SPC SPC") and type in
"helpful-variable". Before we run it by hitting RET (enter), we notice &#x2013;
thanks to helm, an emacs completion package &#x2013; that the keybinding already
set for that command is "C-h v". Good to know. Press ESC to exit.
</p>

<p>
"SPC b d", ESC, q and C-g are the common default bindings to close a buffer
or window.
</p>

<p>
In our dotspacemacs file let's press "SPC s s" and type in
"dotspacemacs-themes". Make sure our cursor is placed on the variable
"dotspacemacs-themes" and use the keybind we learned earlier: "C-h v". The
variable at our cursor is filled in and a helpful buffer is drawn up. Give
it a quick read. If you are curious you can compare it to "SPC h d v" with
the cursor on the same point. Try swapping the "dotspacemacs-themes"
variable. Save, "SPC f s" and reload "SPC f e R".

I have kept this for last because this adds quite a bit of complexity to the
installation process. It's best to make sure the above is familiar before
marching on. WSL2 networking is still very much a work in progress, and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/wslg">WSLg</a>
will be restricted to Windows 11 only. <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1474559/wsl2-x11-programs-disappear%20">Therefore X server sessions are not kept
alive</a> after the computer goes to sleep. This can be a deal breaker for some. If
that is the case, then here is the workaround I use: <a href="https://derkoe.dev/blog/development-environment-in-wsl2/%20">courtesy of Mr. Christian Koberl.</a>
</p>

<p>
DO NOT uninstall or change your previous VCXSRV setup. I keep both X2Go and
VCXSRV open as otherwise my clipboard will stop working. Hard to debug.
</p>

<p>
After each WSL/Windows restart
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Launch ssh in Linux (if not started yet): sudo service ssh start</li>
<li>Launch “X2Go Client” on Windows ad connect to the server with WSL user/password</li>
<li>Now you can launch X11 apps via the tray icon (see X2Go Published Applications)</li>
</ul>

<p>
To get sound you can use this link, <a href="https://www.linuxuprising.com/2021/03/how-to-get-sound-pulseaudio-to-work-on.html">How To Get Sound (PulseAudio) To Work On
WSL2 - Linux Uprising Blog</a>
</p>

<p>
The reason I do not use this option is due to battery usage as indicated by the
Windows task manager. X2go client uses pulseaudio server and the cpu usage for
<code>windows audio process</code> will be stuck around 8-10% CPU. My elfeed-mpv function
is also very slow. I will have to wait until Windows 11 with WSLg before
managing my music with Emacs.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Under Options → Settings → Pulseaudio settings, you can now disable audio input
(microphone support.) This itself is desirable for many users, but it also
serves as a workaround for the issue of PulseAudio failing to do output simply
because input is unavailable. &#x2013; <a href="https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:release-notes-mswin:x2goclient-4.0.5.1">doc:release-notes-mswin:x2goclient-4.0.5.1 {X2Go - everywhere@home}</a>
